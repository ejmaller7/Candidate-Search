  ## Description
  The Candidate Search is meant to provide users with a way to search for users on github and either accept the candidates or reject the candidates. After accepting candidates, a list is provided on another page to display all of the candidates that are accepted. On this page, there is information displaying all of the information seen on the previous page with an added element that allows the user to remove candidates from the list if they desire to. The 'Home' page is where you are able to search for candidates and the 'Saved Candidates' page is where you can find all of the candidates you have accepted.

  ## Installation
  ```
  npm install OR npm install --include=dev
  ```

  ## Usage
  While using the repo, ensure that you have a server up and running by typing the command 'npm run dev'. This allows a user to see any changes that they make within the code immediately instead of having to wait and refresh the page. The repo is divided into multiple folders: Api - Api.tsx, Components - Nav.tsx, Interfaces - Candidate.interface.tsx, Pages - CandidateSearch.tsx | ErrorPage.tsx | SavedCandidates.tsx, and the main SRC folder that holds all of those folders along with the App.tsx and Main.tsx files.
